                    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
                    and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
                    Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature
                    , make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
                    in many areas on most platforms.

                    Python Variable is containers which store values.
                    Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables
                    before using them or declare their type.
                    A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.
                    A Python variable is a name given to a memory location.
                    It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

                    <h3> Rules for assigning a variable </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.</li>
                        <li>A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
                        <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).</li>
                        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).</li>
                        <li>The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.</li>
                    </ul>

                    There comes situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next.
                    Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code.
                    Decision-making statements in programming languages decide the direction of the flow of program execution. 
                    In Python, if-else elif statement is used for decision making.
                </p>

                <h3> if statement </h3>
                <p>
                    if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used
                    to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed
                    or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement
                    is executed otherwise not.
                    
                    <div class = 'mkl'>
                        
                        
                        <pre><code>if condition:
   statement1
statement2

# Here if the condition is true, if block 
# will consider only statement1 to be inside 
# its block. </code></pre>
                       
                    </div>
                </p>

                <h3> if-else statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true
                    it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t.
                    But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with
                    if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

                    <div class = 'mkl'>
                        <pre><code>if (condition):
    # Executes this block 
    # if condition is true
    
else:
    # Executes this block if
    # condition is false</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Python programming language provides the following types
                    of loops to handle looping requirements. Python provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality,
                    they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.
                </p>

                <h3> for Loop</h3>
                <p>
                    For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or
                    string or array etc. In Python, there is no C style for loop.
                    There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each loop in other languages.
                    Let us learn how to use for in loop for sequential traversals.
                <div class = 'mkl'>
                <pre><code>for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)</code></pre>
</div>
                </p>

                <h3>while loop</h3>
                <p>
                    In python, while loop is used to execute a block of
                    statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
                    And when the condition becomes false,
                    the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

                    <div class = 'mkl'>
                        <pre><code>while expression:
    statement(s)</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </p>
